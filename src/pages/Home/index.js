    <p>Â´Â´A Frontend Developer with 2 years of industrial experience. When it comes to work, IÂ´m very emotional, ambitious and passionate. I would describe myself as success-driven and a team player. I will gladly accept constructive criticism that will help me make further progress not only as a developer, but also as a person.
    Regarding my free time, I try to work on expanding my knowledge by reading books and watching videos on various technologies.

    Also, I consider myself as a gadget maniac ðŸ˜Ž.Â´Â´</p>
